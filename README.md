# Todo

This is an Angular-based to-do app. It begins with a login page, which redirects to the to-do list only if the username is 'admin' and the password is '12345'.
Upon logging in, the user is redirected to the to-do list, and when the user checks 5 boxes, a prompt congratulating the user is shown. Clicking the logout 
button redirects back to the login page.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.1.

## Development server
